# Diary

This is a Java-project that I made together with 5 other students. The project is a diary application, that has a
graphic user interface and database connection where to entries can be stored.

Features so far:

One JavaFX scene which holds:
1. Textinput fields for user to add desired headline and entry.
2. Add-button for adding entries, Old entries -button to bring entries from database, cancel-button to reset text input fields.
3. Textfield (Label) which holds all the entries.

Database connection works and user is able to view old entries if they choose to.
We only have local database using MySQL community server.
